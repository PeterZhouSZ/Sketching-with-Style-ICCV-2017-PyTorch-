# Sketching-with-Style-ICCV-2017-PyTorch-
This is an un-official re-implementation of the work **[Sketching with Style presented](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Collomosse_Sketching_With_Style_ICCV_2017_paper.html)** at [ICCV 2017](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com/) by Prof. John Collomosse's Group and Adobe.

The current version of the code only includes the architecture models for the Style Representation Learning, till section 3.2.1 of the paper. (Although the code for the Content Representation Learning pipeline is also very similar and the code can be adapted to extend this very easily).

Dependencies:

 * Python3
 * PyTorch (and other dependencies for PyTorch)
 * Numpy
 * OpenCV 3.3.0
 * Visdom Line Plotter
 * tqdm
 * cudnn (CUDA for training on GPU)
